# Human-Resources

## Access 
You can access the app by clicking this link: https://whispering-fjord-81362.herokuapp.com/

## Approach
To build an efficient way that human resource teams can store and manipulate data about the employees at their company.

## Technologies Used
We used express to develop a back-end app and used mongoose to store the data from the app. We also implemented espress-sessions to store a user's session and track if the user is logged in or not. 

## User Stories
As a human resource officer, I want to be able to view the other hr officers at my company, and be able to view or create employee profiles that only me and the other hr officers at my company can see.

### Stretch Goals
Some ideas we can further implement into the app in the future: 
- add API
- add scheduling system (adding a calendar)
- add login with google feature
