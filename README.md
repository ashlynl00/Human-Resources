# Human-Resources

## Access 
You can access the app by clicking this link: https://whispering-fjord-81362.herokuapp.com/

## Approach
To build an efficient way that human resource teams can store and manipulate data about the employees at their company.

## Technologies Used
We used express to develop a back-end app and used mongoose to store the data from the app. We also implemented espress-sessions to store a user's session and track if the user is logged in or not. 

### Stretch Goals
Some ideas we can further implement into the app in the future: 
- add API
- add scheduling system (adding a calendar)
- add login with google feature
